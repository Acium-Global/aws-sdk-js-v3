/**
 * <p>Upgrades a single directory in-place using the <code>PublishedSchemaArn</code> with schema updates found in <code>MinorVersion</code>. Backwards-compatible minor version upgrades are instantaneously available for readers on all objects in the directory. Note: This is a synchronous API call and upgrades only one schema on a given directory per call. To upgrade multiple directories from one schema, you would need to call this API on each directory.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudDirectoryClient, UpgradeAppliedSchemaCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudDirectoryClient, UpgradeAppliedSchemaCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudDirectoryClient(config);
 * const command = new UpgradeAppliedSchemaCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link UpgradeAppliedSchemaCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link UpgradeAppliedSchemaCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudDirectoryClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
