/**
 * <p>Creates a new schema in a development state. A schema can exist in three
 *       phases:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <i>Development:</i> This is a mutable phase of the schema. All new
 *           schemas are in the development phase. Once the schema is finalized, it can be
 *           published.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <i>Published:</i> Published schemas are immutable and have a version
 *           associated with them.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>
 *                   <i>Applied:</i> Applied schemas are mutable in a way that allows you
 *           to add new schema facets. You can also add new, nonrequired attributes to existing schema
 *           facets. You can apply only published schemas to directories. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudDirectoryClient, CreateSchemaCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudDirectoryClient, CreateSchemaCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-clouddirectory"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudDirectoryClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateSchemaCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateSchemaCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateSchemaCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudDirectoryClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
