/**
 * <p>Gets information about backups of AWS CloudHSM clusters.</p>
 *          <p>This is a paginated operation, which means that each response might contain only a
 *       subset of all the backups. When the response contains only a subset of backups, it includes a
 *         <code>NextToken</code> value. Use this value in a subsequent <code>DescribeBackups</code>
 *       request to get more backups. When you receive a response with no <code>NextToken</code> (or an
 *       empty or null value), that means there are no more backups to get.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CloudHSMV2Client, DescribeBackupsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-cloudhsm-v2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CloudHSMV2Client, DescribeBackupsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudhsm-v2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CloudHSMV2Client(config);
 * const command = new DescribeBackupsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DescribeBackupsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DescribeBackupsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CloudHSMV2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
