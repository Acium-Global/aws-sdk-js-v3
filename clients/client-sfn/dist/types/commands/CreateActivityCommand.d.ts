/**
 * <p>Creates an activity. An activity is a task that you write in any programming language and
 *       host on any machine that has access to AWS Step Functions. Activities must poll Step Functions using the
 *         <code>GetActivityTask</code> API action and respond using <code>SendTask*</code> API
 *       actions. This function lets Step Functions know the existence of your activity and returns an
 *       identifier for use in a state machine and when polling from the activity.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>This operation is eventually consistent. The results are best effort and may not reflect very recent updates and changes.</p>
 *          </note>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>
 *                <code>CreateActivity</code> is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests wonâ€™t create a
 *         duplicate resource if it was already created. <code>CreateActivity</code>'s idempotency
 *         check is based on the activity <code>name</code>. If a following request has different
 *           <code>tags</code> values, Step Functions will ignore these differences and treat it as an
 *         idempotent request of the previous. In this case, <code>tags</code> will not be updated,
 *         even if they are different.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SFNClient, CreateActivityCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sfn"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SFNClient, CreateActivityCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sfn"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SFNClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateActivityCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateActivityCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateActivityCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SFNClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
