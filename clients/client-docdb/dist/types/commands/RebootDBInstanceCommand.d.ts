/**
 * <p>You might need to reboot your instance, usually for maintenance reasons. For
 *             example, if you make certain changes, or if you change the cluster parameter group
 *             that is associated with the instance, you must reboot the instance for the changes to
 *             take effect. </p>
 *         <p>Rebooting an instance restarts the database engine service. Rebooting an instance
 *             results in a momentary outage, during which the instance status is set to
 *                 <i>rebooting</i>. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { DocDBClient, RebootDBInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-docdb"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { DocDBClient, RebootDBInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-docdb"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new DocDBClient(config);
 * const command = new RebootDBInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link RebootDBInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link RebootDBInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link DocDBClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
