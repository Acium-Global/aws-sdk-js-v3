/**
 * <p>Determines the details for the room from which a skill request was invoked. This
 *          operation is used by skill developers.</p>
 *          <p>To query ResolveRoom from an Alexa skill, the skill ID needs to be authorized. When
 *          the skill is using an AWS Lambda function, the skill is automatically authorized when you
 *          publish your skill as a private skill to your AWS account. Skills that are hosted using a
 *          custom web service must be manually authorized. To get your skill authorized, contact AWS
 *          Support with your AWS account ID that queries the ResolveRoom API and skill ID. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { AlexaForBusinessClient, ResolveRoomCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { AlexaForBusinessClient, ResolveRoomCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-alexa-for-business"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new AlexaForBusinessClient(config);
 * const command = new ResolveRoomCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link ResolveRoomCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link ResolveRoomCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link AlexaForBusinessClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
