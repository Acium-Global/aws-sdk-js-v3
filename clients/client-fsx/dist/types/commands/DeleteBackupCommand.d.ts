/**
 * <p>Deletes an Amazon FSx backup, deleting its contents. After deletion, the backup no longer exists, and its data is gone.</p>
 *
 *         <p>The <code>DeleteBackup</code> call returns instantly. The backup will not show up
 *             in later <code>DescribeBackups</code> calls.</p>
 *
 *         <important>
 *             <p>The data in a deleted backup is also deleted and can't be recovered by any
 *                 means.</p>
 *         </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { FSxClient, DeleteBackupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-fsx"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { FSxClient, DeleteBackupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-fsx"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new FSxClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteBackupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteBackupCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteBackupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link FSxClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
