 *             <b>Required Permissions</b>: To use this action, an IAM user must have a Deploy or Manage

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OpsWorksClient, CreateDeploymentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-opsworks"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OpsWorksClient, CreateDeploymentCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-opsworks"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OpsWorksClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateDeploymentCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateDeploymentCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateDeploymentCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link OpsWorksClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
