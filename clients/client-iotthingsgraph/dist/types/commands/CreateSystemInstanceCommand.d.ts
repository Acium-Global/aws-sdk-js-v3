/**
 * <p>Creates a system instance. </p>
 *          <p>This action validates the system instance, prepares the deployment-related resources. For Greengrass deployments, it updates the Greengrass group that is
 *             specified by the <code>greengrassGroupName</code> parameter. It also adds a file to the S3 bucket specified by the <code>s3BucketName</code> parameter. You need to
 *             call <code>DeploySystemInstance</code> after running this action.</p>
 *          <p>For Greengrass deployments, since this action modifies and adds resources to a Greengrass group and an S3 bucket on the caller's behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions
 *          to both the specified Greengrass group and S3 bucket. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authorization error.</p>
 *          <p>For cloud deployments, this action requires a <code>flowActionsRoleArn</code> value. This is an IAM role
 *       that has permissions to access AWS services, such as AWS Lambda and AWS IoT, that the flow uses when it executes.</p>
 *          <p>If the definition document doesn't specify a version of the user's namespace, the latest version will be used by default.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IoTThingsGraphClient, CreateSystemInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iotthingsgraph"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IoTThingsGraphClient, CreateSystemInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotthingsgraph"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IoTThingsGraphClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateSystemInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateSystemInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateSystemInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IoTThingsGraphClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
