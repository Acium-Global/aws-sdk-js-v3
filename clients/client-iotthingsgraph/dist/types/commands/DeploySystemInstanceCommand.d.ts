 *          <p>If the system or any workflows and entities have been updated before this action is called, then the deployment will create a new Amazon Simple Storage Service
 *          resource file and then deploy it.</p>
 *          <p>Since this action creates a Greengrass deployment on the caller's behalf, the calling identity must have write permissions
 *          to the specified Greengrass group. Otherwise, the call will fail with an authorization error.</p>
 *          <p>For information about the artifacts that get added to your Greengrass core device when you use this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/thingsgraph/latest/ug/iot-tg-greengrass.html">AWS IoT Things Graph and AWS IoT Greengrass</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IoTThingsGraphClient, DeploySystemInstanceCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iotthingsgraph"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IoTThingsGraphClient, DeploySystemInstanceCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iotthingsgraph"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IoTThingsGraphClient(config);
 * const command = new DeploySystemInstanceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeploySystemInstanceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeploySystemInstanceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IoTThingsGraphClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
