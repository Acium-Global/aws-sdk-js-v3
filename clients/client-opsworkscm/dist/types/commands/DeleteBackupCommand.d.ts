/**
 * <p>
 *       Deletes a backup. You can delete both manual and automated backups. This operation is asynchronous.
 *     </p>
 *          <p>
 *       An <code>InvalidStateException</code> is thrown when a backup deletion is already in progress.
 *       A <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code> is thrown when the backup does not exist.
 *       A <code>ValidationException</code> is thrown when parameters of the request are not valid.
 *     </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { OpsWorksCMClient, DeleteBackupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-opsworkscm"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { OpsWorksCMClient, DeleteBackupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-opsworkscm"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new OpsWorksCMClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteBackupCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteBackupCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteBackupCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link OpsWorksCMClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
