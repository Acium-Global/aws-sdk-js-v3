/**
 * <p>Create a new predictive inbox placement test. Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled
 *             by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a
 *             sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers. Amazon Pinpoint
 *             then sends that message to special email addresses spread across several major email
 *             providers. After about 24 hours, the test is complete, and you can use the
 *                 <code>GetDeliverabilityTestReport</code> operation to view the results of the
 *             test.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PinpointEmailClient, CreateDeliverabilityTestReportCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PinpointEmailClient, CreateDeliverabilityTestReportCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PinpointEmailClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateDeliverabilityTestReportCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateDeliverabilityTestReportCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateDeliverabilityTestReportCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PinpointEmailClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
