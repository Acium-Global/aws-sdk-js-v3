/**
 * <p>Create a configuration set. <i>Configuration sets</i> are groups of
 *             rules that you can apply to the emails you send using Amazon Pinpoint. You apply a configuration
 *             set to an email by including a reference to the configuration set in the headers of the
 *             email. When you apply a configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that
 *             configuration set are applied to the email. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PinpointEmailClient, CreateConfigurationSetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PinpointEmailClient, CreateConfigurationSetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PinpointEmailClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateConfigurationSetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateConfigurationSetCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateConfigurationSetCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PinpointEmailClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
