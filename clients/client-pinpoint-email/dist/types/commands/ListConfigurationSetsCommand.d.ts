/**
 * <p>List all of the configuration sets associated with your Amazon Pinpoint account in the current
 *             region.</p>
 *         <p>In Amazon Pinpoint, <i>configuration sets</i> are groups of rules that you can
 *             apply to the emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a
 *             reference to the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a
 *             configuration set to an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to
 *             the email.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { PinpointEmailClient, ListConfigurationSetsCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { PinpointEmailClient, ListConfigurationSetsCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-pinpoint-email"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new PinpointEmailClient(config);
 * const command = new ListConfigurationSetsCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link ListConfigurationSetsCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link ListConfigurationSetsCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link PinpointEmailClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
