/**
 * <p>Compares a face in the <i>source</i> input image with
 *       each of the 100 largest faces detected in the <i>target</i> input image.
 *     </p>
 *
 *          <p> If the source image contains multiple faces, the service detects the largest face
 *         and compares it with each face detected in the target image. </p>
 *
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>CompareFaces uses machine learning algorithms, which are probabilistic.
 *       A false negative is an incorrect prediction that
 *       a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face
 *       in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives,
 *       we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images.
 *       If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights,
 *       privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further
 *       validation before taking action.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *
 *          <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as
 *       references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the
 *       AWS
 *       CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes isn't
 *       supported. The image must be formatted as a PNG or JPEG file. </p>
 *          <p>In response, the operation returns an array of face matches ordered by similarity score
 *       in descending order. For each face match, the response provides a bounding box of the face,
 *       facial landmarks, pose details (pitch, role, and yaw), quality (brightness and sharpness), and
 *       confidence value (indicating the level of confidence that the bounding box contains a face).
 *       The response also provides a similarity score, which indicates how closely the faces match. </p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>By default, only faces with a similarity score of greater than or equal to 80% are
 *         returned in the response. You can change this value by specifying the
 *           <code>SimilarityThreshold</code> parameter.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *          <p>
 *             <code>CompareFaces</code> also returns an array of faces that don't match the source image.
 *       For each face, it returns a bounding box, confidence value, landmarks, pose details, and quality.
 *     The response also returns information about the face in the source image, including the bounding box
 *       of the face and confidence value.</p>
 *
 *          <p>The <code>QualityFilter</code> input parameter allows you to filter out detected faces
 *       that donâ€™t meet a required quality bar. The quality bar is based on a
 *       variety of common use cases.  Use <code>QualityFilter</code> to set the quality bar
 *       by specifying <code>LOW</code>, <code>MEDIUM</code>, or <code>HIGH</code>.
 *       If you do not want to filter detected faces, specify <code>NONE</code>. The default value is <code>NONE</code>. </p>
 *
 *          <p>If the image doesn't contain Exif metadata, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns orientation information for the
 *         source and target images. Use these values to display the images with the correct image orientation.</p>
 *          <p>If no faces are detected in the source or target images, <code>CompareFaces</code> returns an
 *     <code>InvalidParameterException</code> error. </p>
 *
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p> This is a stateless API operation. That is, data returned by this operation doesn't persist.</p>
 *          </note>
 *
 *
 *          <p>For an example, see Comparing Faces in Images in the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.</p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions to perform the <code>rekognition:CompareFaces</code>
 *       action.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { RekognitionClient, CompareFacesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { RekognitionClient, CompareFacesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-rekognition"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new RekognitionClient(config);
 * const command = new CompareFacesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CompareFacesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CompareFacesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link RekognitionClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
