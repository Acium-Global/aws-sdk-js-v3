/**
 * <p>Retrieves information about a fleet's instances, including instance IDs, connection
 *             data, and status. </p>
 *         <p>This operation can be used in the following ways:</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>To get information on all instances that are deployed to a fleet's home
 *                     Region, provide the fleet ID.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>To get information on all instances that are deployed to a fleet's remote
 *                     location, provide the fleet ID and location name.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>To get information on a specific instance in a fleet, provide the fleet ID and
 *                     instance ID.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>Use the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. </p>
 *         <p>If successful, an <code>Instance</code> object is returned for each requested
 *             instance. Instances are not returned in any particular order. </p>
