 * <p>Retrieves a fresh set of credentials for use when uploading a new set of game build
 *             files to Amazon GameLift's Amazon S3. This is done as part of the build creation process; see
 *                 <a>CreateBuild</a>.</p>
 *         <p>To request new credentials, specify the build ID as returned with an initial
 *                 <code>CreateBuild</code> request. If successful, a new set of credentials are
 *             returned, along with the S3 storage location associated with the build ID.</p>
