/**
 * <p>Retrieves information on a fleet's remote locations, including life-cycle status and
 *             any suspended fleet activity. </p>
 *         <p>This operation can be used in the following ways: </p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>To get data for specific locations, provide a fleet identifier and a list of
 *                     locations. Location data is returned in the order that it is requested. </p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>To get data for all locations, provide a fleet identifier only. Location data
 *                     is returned in no particular order. </p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>When requesting attributes for multiple locations, use the pagination parameters to
 *             retrieve results as a set of sequential pages. </p>
 *         <p>If successful, a <code>LocationAttributes</code> object is returned for each requested
 *             location. If the fleet does not have a requested location, no information is returned.
 *             This operation does not return the home Region. To get information on a fleet's home
 *             Region, call <code>DescribeFleetAttributes</code>.</p>
