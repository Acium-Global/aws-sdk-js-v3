/**
 * <p>Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking
 *             rules. With games that use GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers GameLift
 *             to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each
 *             matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the
 *             FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to
 *             build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team
 *             and finding additional players as needed to fill the match. </p>
 *         <p>To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration,
 *             and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that
 *             are required by the matchmaking configuration's rule set. If successful, a matchmaking
 *             ticket is returned with status set to <code>QUEUED</code>. </p>
 *         <p>Track matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection
 *             information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using
 *             event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking
 *             configuration.</p>
