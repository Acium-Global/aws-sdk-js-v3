/**
 * <p>For a blue/green deployment, starts the process of rerouting traffic from instances in
 *             the original environment to instances in the replacement environment without waiting for
 *             a specified wait time to elapse. (Traffic rerouting, which is achieved by registering
 *             instances in the replacement environment with the load balancer, can start as soon as
 *             all instances have a status of Ready.) </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { CodeDeployClient, ContinueDeploymentCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { CodeDeployClient, ContinueDeploymentCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-codedeploy"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new CodeDeployClient(config);
 * const command = new ContinueDeploymentCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link ContinueDeploymentCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link ContinueDeploymentCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link CodeDeployClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
