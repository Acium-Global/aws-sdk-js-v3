/**
 * <p>AWS IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them.
 *     You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it.  AWS IoT Analytics enables advanced
 *     data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration
 *     with Amazon QuickSight.</p>
 *
 *          <p>Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data
 *     often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result
 *     the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be
 *     cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data
 *     from external sources. </p>
 *
 *          <p>AWS IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. AWS IoT Analytics
 *     filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You
 *     can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms
 *     to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location
 *     before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine,
 *     or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. AWS IoT Analytics includes pre-built models
 *     for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to fail or which customers
 *     are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.</p>
