/**
 * <p>The WorkDocs API is designed for the following use cases:</p>
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>File Migration: File migration applications are supported for users who
 *                     want to migrate their files from an on-premises or off-premises file system or
 *                     service. Users can insert files into a user directory structure, as well as
 *                     allow for basic metadata changes, such as modifications to the permissions of
 *                     files.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have
 *                     additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API
 *                     actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when
 *                     changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary
 *                     actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the
 *                     application can also choose to email the user.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 <p>eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported,
 *                     such as eDiscovery and analytics. These applications can choose to mimic or
 *                     record the actions in an Amazon WorkDocs site, along with AWS CloudTrail, to
 *                     replicate data for eDiscovery, backup, or analytical applications.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *         <p>All Amazon WorkDocs API actions are Amazon authenticated and certificate-signed.
 *             They not only require the use of the AWS SDK, but also allow for the exclusive use of
 *             IAM users and roles to help facilitate access, trust, and permission policies. By
 *             creating a role and allowing an IAM user to access the Amazon WorkDocs site, the IAM
 *             user gains full administrative visibility into the entire Amazon WorkDocs site (or as
 *             set in the IAM policy). This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to modify file
 *             permissions and upload any file to any user. This allows developers to perform the three
 *             use cases above, as well as give users the ability to grant access on a selective basis
 *             using the IAM model.</p>
