 * const client = new ServiceCatalogAppRegistryClient(config);
 * const command = new SyncResourceCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link SyncResourceCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link SyncResourceCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ServiceCatalogAppRegistryClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
