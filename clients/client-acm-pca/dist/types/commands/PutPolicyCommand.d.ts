 * 			Access</a>.</p>
 * 		       <p>The policy can be displayed with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_GetPolicy.html">GetPolicy</a> and removed with <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/API_DeletePolicy.html">DeletePolicy</a>.</p>

 * 			            <p>A policy grants access on a private CA to an AWS customer account, to AWS Organizations, or to
 * 			an AWS Organizations unit. Policies are under the control of a CA administrator. For more information,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-rbp.html">Using a Resource Based Policy with ACM Private CA</a>.</p>
 * 		          </li>
 *             <li>
 * 			            <p>A policy permits a user of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to issue ACM certificates
 * 			signed by a CA in another account.</p>
 * 		          </li>
 *             <li>
 * 			            <p>For ACM to manage automatic renewal of these certificates,
 * 			the ACM user must configure a Service Linked Role (SLR). The SLR allows
 * 			the ACM service to assume the identity of the user, subject to confirmation against the
 * 			ACM Private CA policy. For more information, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-slr.html">Using a
 *             Service Linked Role with ACM</a>.</p>
 * 		          </li>
 *             <li>
 * 			            <p>Updates made in AWS Resource Manager (RAM) are reflected in policies. For more information,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/userguide/pca-ram.html">Attach a Policy for Cross-Account
 * 			Access</a>.</p>

 * const client = new ACMPCAClient(config);
 * const command = new PutPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);

 * @see {@link PutPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ACMPCAClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
