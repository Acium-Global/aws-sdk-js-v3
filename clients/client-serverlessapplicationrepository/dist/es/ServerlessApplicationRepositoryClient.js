/**
 * <p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository makes it easy for developers and enterprises to quickly find
 *  and deploy serverless applications in the AWS Cloud. For more information about serverless applications,
 *  see Serverless Computing and Applications on the AWS website.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository is deeply integrated with the AWS Lambda console, so that developers of
 *  all levels can get started with serverless computing without needing to learn anything new. You can use category
 *  keywords to browse for applications such as web and mobile backends, data processing applications, or chatbots.
 *  You can also search for applications by name, publisher, or event source. To use an application, you simply choose it,
 *  configure any required fields, and deploy it with a few clicks. </p><p>You can also easily publish applications, sharing them publicly with the community at large, or privately
 *  within your team or across your organization. To publish a serverless application (or app), you can use the
 *  AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or AWS SDKs to upload the code. Along with the
 *  code, you upload a simple manifest file, also known as the AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template.
 *  For more information about AWS SAM, see AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) on the AWS Labs
 *  GitHub repository.</p><p>The AWS Serverless Application Repository Developer Guide contains more information about the two developer
 *  experiences available:</p><ul>
 *  <li>
 *  <p>Consuming Applications – Browse for applications and view information about them, including
 *  source code and readme files. Also install, configure, and deploy applications of your choosing. </p>
 *  <p>Publishing Applications – Configure and upload applications to make them available to other
 *  developers, and publish new versions of applications. </p>
 *  </li>
 *  </ul>
