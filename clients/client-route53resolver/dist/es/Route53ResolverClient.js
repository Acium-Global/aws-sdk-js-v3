/**
 * <p>When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution within the VPC
 * 			from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names
 * 			such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
 * 			Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
 * 			names.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection:</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>
 *             <b>Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver</b>
 *          </p>
 *
 * 		       <p>DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers
 * 			to easily resolve domain names for AWS resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone.
 * 			For more information, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-network-to-vpc">How DNS Resolvers
 * 			on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>
 *             <b>Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network</b>
 *          </p>
 *
 * 		       <p>You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network.
 * 			To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward
 * 			(such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to.
 * 			If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match
 * 			(acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see
 * 			<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html#resolver-overview-forward-vpc-to-network">How Route 53 Resolver
 * 			Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network</a> in the <i>Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide</i>.</p>
 *
 * 		       <p>Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose
 * 			whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your
 * 			network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.</p>
