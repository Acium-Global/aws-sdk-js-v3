/**
 * <p>Deletes stored utterances.</p>
 *          <p>Amazon Lex stores the utterances that users send to your bot. Utterances
 *       are stored for 15 days for use with the <a>GetUtterancesView</a> operation, and then stored indefinitely for use in improving the
 *       ability of your bot to respond to user input.</p>
 *          <p>Use the <code>DeleteUtterances</code> operation to manually delete
 *       stored utterances for a specific user. When you use the
 *         <code>DeleteUtterances</code> operation, utterances stored for improving
 *       your bot's ability to respond to user input are deleted immediately.
 *       Utterances stored for use with the <code>GetUtterancesView</code>
 *       operation are deleted after 15 days.</p>
 *          <p>This operation requires permissions for the
 *         <code>lex:DeleteUtterances</code> action.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteUtterancesCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { LexModelBuildingServiceClient, DeleteUtterancesCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-lex-model-building-service"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new LexModelBuildingServiceClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteUtterancesCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteUtterancesCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link LexModelBuildingServiceClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
