/**
 * <p>Detective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and
 *          investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically
 *          extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from
 *          AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by
 *          Amazon GuardDuty.</p>
 *          <p>The Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A
 *          behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created
 *          and managed by an administrator account.</p>
 *          <p>Every behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs
 *          that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.</p>
 *          <p>A Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Enable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>View the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Add member accounts to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Remove member accounts from a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>A member account can use the Detective API to do the following:</p>
 *          <ul>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>View the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Accept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Decline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                <p>Remove their account from a behavior graph.</p>
 *             </li>
 *          </ul>
 *          <p>All API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/detective/latest/adminguide/logging-using-cloudtrail.html">Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>We replaced the term "master account" with the term "administrator account." An
 *             administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of
 *             Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior graph.</p>
 *          </note>
