/**
 * <p>The DeletePipeline operation removes a pipeline.</p>
 *         <p> You can only delete a pipeline that has never been used or that is not currently in use
 *             (doesn't contain any active jobs). If the pipeline is currently in use,
 *                 <code>DeletePipeline</code> returns an error. </p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ElasticTranscoderClient, DeletePipelineCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-elastic-transcoder"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ElasticTranscoderClient, DeletePipelineCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-elastic-transcoder"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ElasticTranscoderClient(config);
 * const command = new DeletePipelineCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeletePipelineCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeletePipelineCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link ElasticTranscoderClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
