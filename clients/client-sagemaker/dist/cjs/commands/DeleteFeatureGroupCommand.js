 * <p>Delete the <code>FeatureGroup</code> and any data that was written to the
 *             <code>OnlineStore</code> of the <code>FeatureGroup</code>. Data cannot be accessed from

 *          <p>Data written into the <code>OfflineStore</code> will not be deleted. The AWS Glue

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, DeleteFeatureGroupCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeleteFeatureGroupCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
