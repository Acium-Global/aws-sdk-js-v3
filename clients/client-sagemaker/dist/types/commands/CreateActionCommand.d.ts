/**
 * <p>Creates an <i>action</i>. An action is a lineage tracking entity that
 *         represents an action or activity. For example, a model deployment or an HPO job.
 *         Generally, an action involves at least one input or output artifact. For more information, see
 *         <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lineage-tracking.html">Amazon SageMaker
 *           ML Lineage Tracking</a>.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>
 *                <code>CreateAction</code> can only be invoked from within an SageMaker managed
 *           environment. This includes SageMaker training jobs, processing jobs, transform jobs, and SageMaker
 *           notebooks. A call to <code>CreateAction</code> from outside one of these
 *           environments results in an error.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, CreateActionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, CreateActionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateActionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateActionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateActionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SageMakerClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
