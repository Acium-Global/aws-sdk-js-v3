/**
 * <p>Deletes a pipeline if there are no running instances of the pipeline. To delete a
 *         pipeline, you must stop all running instances of the pipeline using the
 *         <code>StopPipelineExecution</code> API. When you delete a pipeline, all instances of the
 *         pipeline are deleted.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SageMakerClient, DeletePipelineCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SageMakerClient, DeletePipelineCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sagemaker"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SageMakerClient(config);
 * const command = new DeletePipelineCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeletePipelineCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeletePipelineCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SageMakerClientResolvedConfig | config} for command's `input` shape.
